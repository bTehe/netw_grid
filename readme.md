# Introduction to the U.S. Power Grid Network Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of the U.S. Power Grid network, specifically the Western States Power Grid. Through network science methodologies, we aim to uncover the structural properties and dynamics of this complex infrastructure. The dataset represents a real-world snapshot of the U.S. power grid's interconnections.

## Network Description
The dataset depicts a network where nodes symbolize power grid components such as transformers, substations, and generators, and edges represent the transmission lines that connect them. This real-world dataset encapsulates the vast, interconnected nature of the U.S. Power Grid.

## Project Scope
Our analysis covers the following essential aspects:

- **Basic Network Statistics:** Quantitative analysis of the network, including the number of nodes and edges, degree distribution, and clustering coefficient.
- **Research Question Formulation:** A clearly defined research question, which guides our analytical focus and results interpretation.
- **Data Analysis & Interpretation:** Detailed network analysis to address the resilience, efficiency, and other critical attributes of the power grid.

The insights from this project aim to enhance the understanding of the U.S. Power Grid's functionality and contribute to discussions on its optimization.

## Research Question
As a starting point for our analytical journey, we propose the following potential research question:

**"How does the structure of the U.S. Western States Power Grid contribute to its resilience against cascading failures, and what are the key network properties that influence its vulnerability to targeted attacks?"**

This research question aims to delve into the robustness of the power grid, examining how its complex structure can withstand disturbances and evaluating the crucial network properties that underpin its defenses against both random and intentional disruptions.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the network dataset.
- `docs/`: Documentation and presentations of the analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for analysis scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
- `README.md`: Introduction and guide to the repository's contents.

Navigate through the repository to access all components of our project. Updates will be posted as the analysis progresses.
